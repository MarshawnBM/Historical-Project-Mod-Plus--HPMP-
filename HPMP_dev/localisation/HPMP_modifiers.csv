EVTDESC999999999;Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality was the dominant imperial ideological doctrine of Russian emperor Nicholas I. The doctrine sought imperial unity under Orthodox Christianity and the absolute authority of the emperor, while suppressing ideas deemed destructive to that unity. "The Triad" of Official Nationality was originally proposed by Minister of Education Sergey Uvarov in his April 2, 1833, circular letter to subordinate educators. It was soon embraced by Nicholas and his establishment and gained wide public recognition, vocally supported by intellectuals like Mikhail Pogodin, Fyodor Tyutchev, and Nikolai Gogol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
