EVTNAME32566;California Dreamin';French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32566;With California under our control, we have achieved one of the guiding principles of Manifest Destiny, our nation finally spans the continent! Many brave pioneers are already making the long trek towards the West Coast, and we’ve heard rumors that the mountain ranges inland are rich with gold, which could prove to catapult both the local and national economy upwards. The one issue that some have raised is the fact that most of the notable settlements still bear the names given to them by the old Spanish Empire, and are worried that English-speaking pioneers could perish on their way to said settlements unless we rename them.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32567;The Old & New Mexico Conundrum;French.;x;;x;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32567;The territory of New Mexico is a fine addition to our nation, however many settlers and politicians are worried that the name of the region might cause confusion when differentiating the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state of New Mexico and the bordering nation of Mexico, and have proposed the territory be renamed to something else… preferably in English.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32568;Desert Jewel;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32568;Nevada is one of the hottest regions of the new $COUNTRY_ADJ$ West, and it shows. Much of the area is inhospitable, with very little precipitation all year round. However, one small settlement is growing quite popular. Near the border with California sits the small town of Las Vegas, which is sustained by irrigation from the nearby Colorado River. Ironically, Las Vegas is Spanish for meadow, which this town is certainly not. Regardless, some are saying we should remove the “Las” from the name, while others propose changing it to New Vegas and integrating the word into English. Clearly, there’s nothing better to do in this town.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32569;America's Heartland;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32569;Colorado is proving to be one of the most popular territories in the West. There are many natural wonders in the territory, and there’s a growing sentimentality among the settlers in the area that Colorado is where the true heart of America resides. With this, some have proposed we rename a few of the lands in the territory to better reflect that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ spirit.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32570;Little Trouble In Big Texas;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32570;Texas was once a state of Mexico, however, this all changed when a large number of American immigrants settled in the northeast segment of the state and eventually declared their independence. As such, it should be no surprise that Texas would eventually become one of the most patriotic states in the country, almost entirely forgetting it was once Mexican. With the land finally free, we can do away with Mexican tyranny in the state by renaming all southern territories to reflect our true culture.;French.;x;;x;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32571;Island of Enchantment;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32571;Puerto Rico, known originally as San Juan Bautista by the first Spanish colonists, is the smallest of the Greater Antilles. Despite it being only around 100 by 35 miles across, most of the coastal towns are heavily populated, particularly in the local capital of San Juan and the southern city of Ponce. Puerto Rico’s economy was heavily centered around gold mining during the 16th century, but was forced to convert to farming after the gold ran out. Though not as successful as Cuba, Puerto Rico is the envy of many colonial empires due to its strategic position. Curiously, the island gets its name from a cartography mistake that switched the name of the capital (Puerto Rico) with the name of the island itself (San Juan). Some prominent cartographers, as well as a few locals, would like it if we rectified this mistake… though we might be able to go further and give the island an English name as well.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32572;Trinity & Tobacco?;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32572;Trinidad is a small island of the Lesser Antilles archipelago, near the coast of South America. While at first glance it seems as just any other island, there has been a tremendous influx of tourists, both $COUNTRY_ADJ$ and foreign, which has bolstered the economy of the small island tremendously. Many ask about the curious name of the island and its sister island Tobago, and apparently, Trinidad is in Spanish and Tobago is an old English word for Tobacco. Some feel we should rename Trinidad in order for it to have an English name like Tobago.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32573;An Old Empire's Crown;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32573;The United States has its history tied with the nation of Haiti. It was thanks to the slave revolt on the island resulting in its independence that Napoleon sold the Louisiana territory to the United States due to the unprofitability of maintaining the empire. Now the island is under our control, and some believe we should rename the island to reflect our “conquest of the old French Empire".;French.;x;;x;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32574;The Antillean Pearl;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32574;The United States has had an interest in the island of Cuba for a long time. Originally, it was thought in the Ostend Manifesto, or Ostend Circular, that the island should be bought from Spain and turned into a slave state. With the island now under our control, perhaps we should rename parts of the island to reflect our ownership of this very profitable island.;x;;x;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32575;Beaches & Beef;French.;x;;x;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32575;The territory of Sonora and the neighboring peninsula of Baja California have been a vital part of our border with Mexico after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the Gadsden Purchase.  It was in this territory that William Walker attempted to repeat the success that was Texas by establishing an independent republic that would eventually join as a state of the Union. We’re seeing a large influx of pioneers make their way to the land of California once more to settle these pristine lands and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ize them thoroughly, a process which we could aid by renaming the lands.;x;;x;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32576;A Match Made In Texas;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32576;Chihuahua is one of the most poorly administrated states in Mexico. Crime is rampant, unemployment is unreasonably high, and the infrastructure is hanging on by a thread. Some are proposing that we rebuild the state entirely from scratch, starting with renaming the local lands to attract $COUNTRY_ADJ$ businessmen and workers into the territory so they may rebuild the state’s economy. Many prominent capitalists and socialites from neighboring Texas have already proposed setting up regional offices in Chihuahua, which they are referring to as West Texas.;x;;x;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32577;The Lion's Den;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32577;Nuevo Leon is known as the region of progress by the local Mexicans. It certainly has potential, being situated on the Atlantic coast makes it easy to import and export goods from our other coast towns, bolstering the local economy and that of surrounding territories. Goods are not the only import, many $COUNTRY_ADJ$s have started to settle in the area, but are having trouble getting around due to nearly every town being in Spanish. Some propose we ease this burden by renaming all major locations with English names.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32578;The New Southwest Coast;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32578;With Durango under our control, it has become $COUNTRY$’s new southwest coast. Like most of our Pacific coast towns, the area is seeing a massive influx of pioneers looking for riches or a whole new life. Much like in the northwest coast, however, some worry that the Spanish names will confuse them and could make the journey perilous. They propose we rename the lands to make the journey easier for our pioneers.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32579;Aztec Oil;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32579;Our survey of Zacatecas has returned with some interesting findings. Firstly, they theorize that the mountains of the territory are rich with silver, which could attract a large influx of prospectors not unlike the one witnessed in California. Secondly, there are reports of a black, tar-like substance that has proven to be quite flammable, with some proposing it could even be used as a fuel. With the prospect of incoming pioneers and industrialists, it may be wise to rename these lands to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our citizens in their long journey.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32580;Jalisco Is Mexico;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32580;What we originally perceived to be a territory of unusually staunch patriotism turned out to be a misguided notion. Now, all our surveyors agree without doubt that the origin of everything we consider Mexican was born in Jalisco, from the arts and music to dress and cuisine. Some fear that an attempt to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ize these land by renaming them would be a mistake and may even spark outrage among the Mexican locals that could lead to open revolt.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32581;Honoring A Revolutionary;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32581;The territory of Morelia, known to the natives as Michoacán, is incredibly diverse in its peoples. Many natives form the population of the land, including descendants from the Aztec Empire and its many tributaries. Interestingly, the most prominent local hero of the territory is a man named Vincente Guerrero, a man of mixed race who fought valiantly for the independence of Mexico from Spanish colonialism. Due to this, some have proposed we rename the land to honor a revolutionary of our own, a fellow man of the people who fought for freedom, justice, and independence.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32582;The Jungles of the Pacific;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32582;Chiapas is one of, if not the most forested state in Mexico. The humid, tropical jungles of the territory make life here physically uncomfortable to most, but where there is hard work to be done, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ men will always be willing to fulfill it. If we were to rename these lands, it may attract more of our citizens to them, making the territory easier to maintain and administer.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32583;Ancient Empire's Throne;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32583;The Yucatan Peninsula was once the home of the ancient Mayan Empire, which ruled much of the southeastern lands of Mexico hundreds of years ago. Though mostly extinct, the Mayan people have survived in the state of Yucatan, and are heralding our people as liberators from the Mexican tyrants. Some think we should capitalize on this and rename the lands to do away with the last vestiges of Mexican rule over the Mayan lands.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32584;This is Destiny Manifest;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32584;When we set out to bring civilization and freedom to this continent, we all knew that it would cement our nation’s place at the world stage. None, however, ever predicted we would come this far. After many perilous trials and struggles, Mexico City is now a part of our budding nation. We’ve grown our country to an undisputable power, and brought freedom and progress to the Mexican people. With this, some propose we rename the lands in the state of Mexico to cement the absolute success of Manifest Destiny.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32585;Towards the Center;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32585;Manifest Destiny dictates we must spread the light of freedom across the continent, and Central America is no exception. The entire region is filled with corrupt dictatorships that must be toppled and washed away, starting with the recently annexed Guatemala. Just as it occurred in Yucatan, the Mayans of Guatemala have come out in support of our annexation, celebrating the end of Central American and Mexican ostracization, looking forward to the bright and democratic future that $COUNTRY$ offers them. As was proposed in Yucatan, some believe we should capitalize on this and rename the lands to erase the tyrannical grip that the previous administration had over these lands.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32586;Liberation of The Savior;French;German;;La Liberación del Salvador;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32586;El Salvador is, to put it mildly, a difficult land. While the territory is sparsely populated, the region has incredible potential for the development of agricultural industries and exports. On the other hand, the previous administration of the territory has been a long and seemingly endless tale of corruption, mismanagement, violence, and anti-democratic repression. Some radical elements in our government feel that it would be best to wipe the slate clean, do away with the old and failed history of the region and start a new chapter, dominated by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ values and culture, starting with renaming the lands of the territory. All for the benefit of the locals, of course.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32587;For All The Goodness;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32587;Honduras is rich in agriculture, especially when it comes to tropical fruits. Unfortunately, since the collapse of the Federal Republic, the land has been plagued with warring political factions vying for control and influence over the government and the lucrative fruit export industry. Meanwhile, there has been a huge flock of businessmen and farmers who have made their way to the territory, noticing the immense but untapped potential of the region’s fruit industry, as well as the odd excursion pursuing rumors of valuable minerals. To minimize the risk of revolt and attacks on our citizens, it may be wise to rename the lands of the territory in order to ease the assimilation process.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32588;A Land of Lakes and Volcanoes;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32588;Nicaragua is the largest state of Central America, and with its larger size it has equally large problems. Politically, the land seems to be embroiled in a perpetual civil war between liberals and conservatives that occasionally flares and cools every so often. Economically, this land is rich in nothing except coffee, and many of our surveyors have borne witness to the outstanding quality of said product, citing the importance and potential of its cultivation and exportation. If we are to pour in so much work to make this land as great as the rest of our states, we should consider renaming the territories in order to attract our citizens to settle and work here, as well as assimilate the local population to our culture.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32589;The Shining City on the Coast;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32589;Costa Rica is the exception to the instability that plagues the rest of Central America. The territory has maintained itself relatively stable since independence from Spain and has a fairly stable economy based on coffee exportation, as well as a respectable level of urban development. It is only natural that we integrate this land into $COUNTRY$ and strengthen the democratic values that both of our peoples hold so dear, a process that can be expedited with the introduction of English names to the lands of the territory.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME32590;The Land Between the Seas;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32590;After a long and righteous struggle, all of Central America is now in our hands. From North to South, East to West, the shining light of freedom has touched the entire continent. With this final victory, we have full control over Panama, and will face no opposition in the construction and operation of a great canal that will connect both oceans. A victory of this magnitude must be commemorated, and we can think of no better tribute to those who perished in this glorious cause than to rename the lands we have freed from tyranny to our mother tongue, so that future generations in these lands know only truth, justice, and the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way.;French;German;;Spanish;;;;;;;;;x
