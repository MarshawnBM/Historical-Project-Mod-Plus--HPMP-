# Historical Project Mod Plus (HPMP)
 Historical Project Mod Plus (HPMP) is a stand-alone update built on HPM 0.4.6.3, building upon it with both bug fixes, and an Expansion of several HPM mechanics I really liked, but felt underdeveloped.

install in your mods folder within victoria 2 as with any mods, delete your map and gfx catche in your victoria 2 documents folder within the HPMP folder
swap out the HPMP folder with the no factory slaves one if you dont want factory slaves
