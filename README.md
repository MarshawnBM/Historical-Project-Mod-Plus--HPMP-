# Historical Project Mod Plus (HPMP)
 Historical Project Mod Plus (HPMP) is a stand-alone update built on HPM 0.4.6.3, building upon it with both bug fixes, and an Expansion of several HPM mechanics I really liked, but felt underdeveloped.

Features include 
*Improved AI based off the AI from Crimeamod

*Added in the 1861 start.

*Toggle-able Forced AI no subsidies

*Toggle-able Reduced Infamy mode

*Toggle-able Subsidies auto subsidies when new factories are built

*Ability to Send money to other players in multiplayer via Grant decisions

*Added flavor for Anarcho-Liberals so they should be unique and fun

*Expanded the HPM totalitarian mechanics to include reactionaries

*Revamped the seizing of the means of production by communist governments so “Liquidating the upper class” causes all capitalist countries to hate the communist country, and for its fellow communists and socialists to love it.

*the ability for countries to take others capitals in war

*modern multiplayer features developed in other mods after HPM stopped development (Grants/loans,

State transfers)

*Added an toggle-able event to hopefully prevent the late game liquidity crisis.

*Revamped Mexican-American War options for U.S. to annex Mexico and for Mexico to refute Manifest Destiny and conquer west coast U.S. territory of its own.

*U.S. can now integrate Canadian tags if it puppets them.

*Event to prevent vassals and members of your sphere of influence from granting military access to enemies

*Slavery Overhaul to provide alternative play styles

*There are now 3 types of slavery, though not mutually exclusive, Racial slavery where non-accepted pops are enslaved, Political prisoner forced labor where militant and ideological enemies are enslaved, Debt Slavery where poor pops without life needs can sell themselves into slavery

*Slaves can now work in factories

*The trans-Atlantic slave trade can now be restarted, though this will make the british angry

*Added the "United Kingdom of Portugal and Brazil" as the premier slaver power if formed, which both Portugal and Brazil can form by puppeting the other

*Added a civil war for the United Kingdom of Portugal and Brazil if slavery is ever abolished

*Any country which has slavery and is disarmed will be forced to abolish it

*Added an additional rule for the UK to have Splendid Isolation like in HFM/GFM

*localization for many countries to have more historical names based on government type

* synthetic rubber and sulfur factories unlocked after 1900 industry techs

*"Victoria 3 mode" which allows any economic policy to build factories or railroads.

*Rebalanced several industry techs to produce better "First" and "Second" Industrial Revolutions, with Iron, Coal, and Steel being the driving force and in high demand. Then around 1870 enough places will be producing those they will become much more common, and things like electrical gears, cars, radios, fuel will become much more important.

*Rebalance how much money factory workers/capitalists/Goldminers get from their jobs, they now keep much more of their paychecks to help them buy the luxury goods available in the late game

*Reverted the change of Liquor factories to "Beverages"

*China and Japan have had their naval ports returned to them.

*Scaling debuffs similar to GFM's to decrease tax and tariff efficiency that will help prevent the ai from sucking up all the money from its pops

*Overhaul for USA and Russian population growths to better match how much they grew IRL during the time
